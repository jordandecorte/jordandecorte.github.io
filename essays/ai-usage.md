## AI Usage in Software Engineering

Aritficial Intelligence (AI) has took the world by storm over the last 2-3 years. It has been especially prominent in Software Engineering, whether it's used to help write programs, debug code or even teach young software engineers better methods to become better at their craft. AI has given software engineers of every skill level, and frankly every person who uses it, the ability to learn in a dynamic way that makes the most sense to them. Our ICS 314 course was completely online so AI played a significant role in helping to understand material that was initially confusing. Outside of that, AI was mainly used for checking syntax errors within my code and helping me debug when I couldn't figure out what was wrong.

## Personal experience with AI

1. Experience WODs: AI was mainly used in these WODs to help with syntax errors and debug my code. For example, E36 which was implementing your choice with bootstrap5, AI was used to help figure out the correct dimensions needed for my page.
2. Practice WODs: AI was mainly used in the practice WODs after I attempted the assignment on my own first. I would then run my code through ChatGPT to check it and make sure there were no issues.
3. Timed WODs: AI wasn't used much during these WODs because they were timed. These WODs were very similar to previous assignments so I would refer to those past assignments. If AI was used it would be for syntax errors mainly.
4. Essays: AI was not used for essays as they weren't necessary to help me formulate thoughts.
5. Final project: AI was used for the final project mainly to help me figure out how to implement my part of the project with the other parts my teammates had. I would ask ChatGPT things like "how can I reference the profile page with my existing chat/page.tsx code", which would help.
6. Learning concepts: AI was mainly used for learning concepts. It's usually hard to find topic specific information on google, so ChatGPT has been a very helpful tool in learning key software engineering concepts.
7. Discord Questions: AI wasn't used for this specific reason. Most of questions I helped other students with in the discord came from the understanding I had of the concepts after I've already done the research on it.
8. Asking Questions: AI wasn't used for asking questions as I felt like the questions I have were already asked in a good and genuine way.
9. Coding Example: AI was used to help provide some example codes to help with the WODs.
10. Explaining Code: AI was helpful in explaining code and highlighting the important parts of the code.
11. Writing Code: AI was mainly used to help implement changes to already existing code that I had. Often times WODs would refer to the previous ones, which sometimes I had difficulty applying new changes to the code I had currently.
12. Documenting Code: AI wasn't used for this aspect of the course, as commenting out your code is good coding practice.
13. Quality Assurance: AI wasn't used for this specific reason as VSCode had auto fixable methods for ESlint errors for example.
14. Other: Haven't really used AI for any other reason than the ones mentioned before.

## AI impact on learning

AI was extremely helpful in learning key concepts that were necessary to make it through this class. As I mentioned above, most times google doesn't have concept  mateiral that answers very specific questions which we often have, such as "why is my PostGRESQL not running on my system". Because of this reason, AI was extremely helpful in solving problems with a reliable source. AI when used as a teacher, instead of a cheat sheet has proved extremely helpful in my journey through this course.

## AI Practical Learning

The versatility of AI is in the fact that it has practical use in everyday life. I've used ChatGPT to help me prepare for some interviews that I've had in the past. ChatGPT helped with learning what professional companies expect from potential employees.

## AI Challenges 

Although AI is extremely helpful it also has it fair share of challenges. It can be seen as a double edge sword. AI can easily be exploited for it's wealth of knowledge by being utilized as a cheat sheet or an answer key as I mentioned above. This is a significant challenge as it can be easy to get used to using AI in that way. AI also isn't perfect and it's bound to get things wrong.

## Comparative Analysis

AI when compared to traditional teaching methods definitely has it's pros and cons. AI is good in the fact that it can be accessed from anyone, from anywhere and at anytime. This allows people to have unlimited access to knowledge. As someone who's an in person learner, AI is bad in the fact that you're not actually learning from someone you can see. This is entirely a subjective point of view because I perosnally learn best from an actual living, breathing professor.

## Future of AI

The future of AI is now. Although it may sound cliche we are already living in an AI era. Even though it's still fairly in its infancy the ceiling for AI to grow is seemingly limitless. AI will soon find its way in every single aspect of everyday life and every industry possible. 

## Conclusion

ICS 314 has definitely been a challenging course which has been good in preparing students for real world expectations. AI helped me learn difficult concepts without having to sift the internet for credible sources. For future consideration, I think it would be helpful to provide AI prompts so students can learn specifically what the teacher wants us to learn.
