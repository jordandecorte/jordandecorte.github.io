## What are coding standards?

Coding standards are generally understood as guidelines or rules that software engineers follow to promote consistency, reliability and readability in ones code. They can be seen as a map of sorts to help people understand what is being done in the code and the persons thoughts while creating the code. However, coding standards can be seen as "trivial", especially after working on coding projects for hours on end. Often times you just don't feel like adding that one extra indentation, or that one extra comment that might help others understand what you're trying to do. Although at times these "coding standards" may seem like a bit much, I believe that they are necessary for programmers of every level to adhere too because it can only benefit an individuals code.

## What makes a question "bad"?

We also have a conception of what "bad" questions look like. "Bad" questions are often times a lot easier to recognize than "good" questions. Sometimes people can categorize questions as "bad" just simply based on the fact that they don't like the question. So let's take a look at what can make a question "bad".

1. Generic/Vague - bad questions are almost always generic or vague in nature. Questions asked in this manner make it hard for other individuals to understand what it is that's wrong or what they can even do to help. One sentence questions also fall victim to being generic or vague.
2. Lack of understanding - bad questions also tend to lack the understanding of whatever it is that you're working on. It is this lack of understanding that causes questions to become generic or vague. It shows that the individual didn't take the time to understand the material or work through solutions on their own.
3. Answer hunting - bad questions almost always just ask what the solution is. This shows that the individual is looking for answers as opposed to an understanding of the issues presented before them.

"Bad" questions can often times present the asker in a negative way. So ditch the "bad" questions and start asking some good ones!

## Survey says: Show me a "good" question... 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70007337/how-to-disable-new-ai-based-intellicode-in-vs-2022

This user asked the question "How to disable new AI-based IntelliCode in VS 2022?". Although it is a very simple question and it is only one sentence it does a very good job at specifying what it is the user wants to know. In the thread the user goes on to explain exactly what his problem is and what he intends to do once the question is answered. The user also provides a step-by-step process on what they did in order to try and fix it. The user also provided screenshots showing specifically what the issues were. This is a perfect example of a "good" question. 

## Survey says: Show me a "bad" question...

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32190976/java-pong-ai-not-moving

This user created a thread and named it "Java-Pong AI not moving". Although this isn't necessarily in question form, it already checks the boxes of what a "bad" question is. The statement is too vague and doesn't provide any specific information on what the user wants to know. In the thread the user says "I am making pong in java but the enemy AI is not moving. It should move to the direction the ball goes to. Please can someone help me?". This is the only information given along with some screenshots of code that doesn't work. This is a question that is specifically looking for an answer and not understanding. This is a perfect example of a "bad" question. 

## Conclusion

So are there really any "dumb" questions? Personally, I think not. Every questions seeks to gain some knowledge that the individual didn't originally have, but there are such things as "good" questions and "bad" questions. Hopefully after reading this people can understand the difference between the two and can start asking questions in a "good" way from now on.
