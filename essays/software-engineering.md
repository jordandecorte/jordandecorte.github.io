## Reflection on Software Engineering

This ICS 314 course has definitely taught me a great deal about software engineering and the practices that are fundamental to the field. Although there are a lot of concepts and ideas to choose from the three I believed were the most important and impactful to me were UI Frameworks, Design Patterns and Configuration Management.

## User Interface Frameworks

User Interface (UI) is essentially aesthetics for the software engineering world. It's the format, the font of the words, the images people see when they open your website etc... This is what what makes your page "pop" or "stand out". Aside from just looks, UI is also concerned with user compatiability. Meaning that a key factor of UI is making websites that are user friendly and easy to understand. For example, in this class we used frameworks like bootstrap5, react and next.js to build our WOD assignemt pages and our final project. I personally found that bootstrap5 was the easiest to use because it was very simple system to learn and use. However, UI is not specific to web design but also frequently used in mobile app and desktop design. The main benefit of UI is that it speeds up development, enforces consistent design patterns, and reduce the likelihood of UI bugs, allowing developers to focus more on functionality rather than spending excessive time on basic design elements.

## Design Patterns

Design patterns are general, reusable solutions to common software design problems. They are not pieces of code you can copy and paste, but rather conceptual templates for solving existing issues. As I mentioned in one of my previous essays, many probelms in the world of software engineering have already been solved. Having these design patterns save software engineers a whole lot of time by allowing them to follow pre-made templates that are proven to work, without having to stress about coding from the ground up. This allows software engineers to focus their time and energy to solving other important issues concerning the task at hand. In this class we utilized Next.js in order to do web development assignments. Provided to us was a link to a Github repository that had a template we could clone to our own repositories that had the essential outline of the page already built. All we needed to do was tailor it to our desired outcome.

## Configuration Management

Configuration Management put simply is the organizing of changes to software, documentation and other important logistical issues when dealing with software engineering practices. I feel like this was the most heavily utilized tool in this course because everything was through Github, where we had to create new repositories, new branches, merge the new branches with the main branch, clone repositores to our VSCode etc... The important aspect of configuration management is accountability. This ensures that everything is accounted for. Meaning everything is documented, time stamped, and accessible. This was extremely prominent when working on the final project. Each member of our team had a specific branch in our final project Github repo. Everything was easily accessible, well documented and time stamped as they should be when collaborating on a project.
