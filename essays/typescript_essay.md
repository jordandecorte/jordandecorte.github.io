## Encountering TypeScript for the first time

Coming into ICS 314, I did not have much experience with JavaScript let alone TypeScript. However, ever since experiencing and interacting with JavaScript/TypeScript I must say that it has been a rather smooth and enjoyable journey. It seems to me that TypeScript is an easier version of JavaScript, where the main purpose of TypeScript is to train you in the main concepts seen in JavaScript. The TypeScript website that we have been using is very clear and concise on what is being asked of us. Which I like because it's like your own personal tutor.

## TypeScript compared to other languages

TypeScript seemed a lot easier to pick up and get used to than languages like C and C++. Maybe it's because of the close similarity to JavaScript, but TypeScript seems to be a lot more straightforward when it comes to declarations and types, which seems to avoid some of the little bugs that might give us errors when running and compiling our code. 

## WOD's (Workouts of the Day)

Workouts of the Day (WOD's) are an entirely new concept for me, and I must say that I have been seeing the benefits from them even though we have only had a few so far. They have been a good way to ensure that you are practicing whatever language it is that you're currently learning. You learn something by doing it, which is what the WOD's force us to do. It's exactly like any physical workout people do, you might not see results after the first couple excercises but if you keep showing up you're bound to see the fruits of your labor.

## AI

The usage of AI is very prevalent within everyday life in todays society. However, the way you use it is what decides the impact it has on your life. I use AI during the assignments whenever I get stuck on tasks and I need a better understanding of the concepts that are being presented. AI being used as a learning tool instead of an answer sheet is what helps me stay ahead of AI.
