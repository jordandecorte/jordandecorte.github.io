## How important are coding standards?

Coding standards are immensely important to coders of every skill level, especially for people who are just beginning their coding journey. As mentioned above, coding standards promotes consistency, reliability and readability. Consistency is important because coding is a repetitve language, as how all other languages are. If you continue to practice you will begin to pick up on patterns that can be applied. Consistency tells you what to expect from your code and although consistency isn't the prettiest skill to have, it sure is one of the most important. Reliability is another important aspect because you want to make sure that your code will do what it was made to do. Reliability comes from consistency because your code becomes reliable after putting in the hours to practice and become consistent. Readability is also an important aspect but I see it more of an aesthetic importance. Readability ensures your code is nice and neat, which makes it easy to read and follow. Having readable code can save hours of headache for others who are trying to understand your code.

## ESLint: Good or Bad?

We have gotten to interact with ESLint for about a week or so now, and there are definitely some good and bad things about my experience while using it. One of the troubles I've had with ESLint is that when I was initially setting it up on my VSCode, there was a bunch of errors that kept popping up one after the other. This cauased me to take a few extra hours to figure out how to get it running smoothly and without compiling errors. Another trouble I had with ESLint was that it was very specific on what it wanted which was hard for me to adjust to because of some shortcuts that I would take while coding. However, ironically enough, that's also what was good about ESLint, was that it forced me to make my code adhere to the "coding standards" as mentioned above. ESLint wasn't just policing my code, it was teaching me a better way to do my code, which I appreaciated. ESLint helps you to get rid of the "good enough" mindset while coding, and help turn good code into great code.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, coding standards are somewhat of a cheat sheet on how to have good code. It's also not an overly complicated topic that only expert level programmers can understand, it is meant for programmers of every skill level. Coding standards will help elevate your game and keep your tools sharp. I know it may seem trivial to people, but sometimes it's the little things that can make the biggest difference. So, like your dating life, keep your coding standards high.
