## What is UI and why is it important?

UI stands for User Interface, and it's the elements of a website or app that the user interacts with. Some of these elements include things such as log in screens, buttons, images etc... Now, these elements can vary depending on the desired layout of your website or app. With that being said, UI is essentially the aesthetics that the user sees everytime they interact with the website or app. It's like the person communicating directly to the machine. For example, pressing a certain button yields a specific result. It is extremely important that UI frameworks are designed in a way that is easy to understand because it is the UI frameworks that will guide a first time user to understand the website or app. Clear, consistent and efficient are some elements that good UI frameworks are built on.

## Is it worth learning?

Saying that UI frameworks are an easy learn would be a flat out lie. In all honestly, it is essentially like learning any other coding language. It takes time, studying and a whole lot of practice. Like everything in life though, once you learn it you will begin to reap the benefits of your labor. Utilizing UI languages such as HTML and CSS, my understanding of what UI frameworks do have gotten a whole lot deeper. It seems to me like HTML and CSS were built entirely for one reason, UI. I know how shocking. However, these languages are really good at keeping things simple and doing UI frameworks really well. There are many software engineering benefits of learning UI frameworks. One of the benefits is design consistency. People can use UI frameworks for the specific reason of designing websites or apps. If used for a team project, it keeps everything in one place. 

## My interaction with HTML and CSS

As mentioned in the previous section, HTML and CSS can be a pain to learn. For software engineers it can easily be written off as just another coding language that can be brushed off without truly understanding what it was intended for. Those were my initial thoughts when going through the tutorial on them. But after learning it and actually trying it out for myself, I can say that I have been pleasantly surprised at how simple and straightforward it is. Whether it was creating replica sites or actually creating my own site from scratch, my interaction with HTML and CSS have been very good. Learning bootstrap 5 was even better, because it sped up the creation of the UI by at least 50 percent in my case, and saving any time looking at a screen is nice. With bootstrap 5, I found that CSS files were no longer needed because you could just keep everything in your main index.html file. However, the down side to this is that at times the index.html file can get long so keeping a separate CSS file for aesthetics can be helpful. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I enjoyed learning about UI frameworks and utilizing HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5 methods to create my own UI frameworks. Whether you choose HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, or maybe some other UI language, the payoff is definitely worth the struggle trying to learn it. It produces better code, cleaner websites and user friendly elements that would keep users coming back to visit your website or app.
